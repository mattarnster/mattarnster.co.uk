[Wave](https://waveapps.com) is a web-based accounting software for freelancers and small companies.

I've been using Wave since August 2018 and I'd like to share my experience for anyone else who is looking to use it.

### Features

- Automatic importing of transactions from your bank account*
- Scheduled invoice generation and sending
- A number of reports on cash flow/profit and loss/expenses, etc.
- Tax and Payroll calculations (only if you're a U.S. based business)
- Guest collaboration for accountants/other people
- Transaction reconciliation
- Credit card payments (through Stripe)
- Setup Products and Services for use on invoices

*This feature is going away as of September 2019 for businesses in the UK.


### Setup and ease of use

Compared to [Intuit QuickBooks](https://quickbooks.com), setting up Wave takes considerably less time. There is an easy to use first-time setup wizard which asks you what you would like to set up for the company.

The options are somewhat vague but they are for the following:

1. Setting up Invoices/Estimates
2. Setting up Bank Feeds
3. Capturing Receipts

Once you click into one of these options, you get another subset of options for setting up the feature.

For instance, if you click the option for setting up Invoices/Estimates, it takes you to an intuitive interface for setting up your invoice look-and-feel.

I'm a big fan of the simplicity of the customization that Wave provides when setting up your invoices and estimates. This isn't all though - they provide 3 styles for your invoices:

### Setting up Bank Connections

Wave is unfortunately phasing out one of my favorite features, Bank Connections. I have relied on their automatic(ish) import of transactions from my business' bank
account.

Getting it set up is pretty easy, just choose your bank:

Wave will then prompt you for the details you use to log into your online banking:

_I know this step seems sketchy but they're used so that Wave's 3rd party bank connection partner can fetch your transactions._

#### Cons of bank connections

If you have any kind of two-factor security for your bank, you'll be asked every time you wish to import these transactions to enter your two-factor security code.
